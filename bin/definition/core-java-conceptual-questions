Please answer the below core-java Questions:


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
Ans: java development toolkit 

What is IDE?
Ans: Integrated Development Environment 

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
Eclipse, Netbeans, IntelJ

Explain the entire java life cycle.
Editor -> Source code -> Java Compiler(Javac) -> Bytecodes(.class) -> Java Virtual Machine(JVM)-> Operating System 
what is class?
A class is blue print or templates for creating different opbjects

What is object?
An object is an instance of class where it define the characteristics of the class

What is the entry point of an application?
main method is the entry point

Why main is static?
when a java program execute, it looks for public static main(String[]args) method. The reason main method is 
static, so that it could be called by JVM without creating an instance of the class.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Java interface are implicitly abstract and cannot have implementations. 
A Java abstract class can have instance methods that implements a default behavior.
Variables declared in a Java interface is by default final. An  abstract class may 
contain non-final variables. Members of a Java interface are public by default. A 
Java abstract class can have private, protected method. Java interface should be 
implemented using keyword “implements”; A Java abstract class should be extended
using keyword “extends”. An abstract class can extend another Java class and implement
multiple Java interfaces. A Java class can implement multiple interfaces but it can 
extend only one abstract class. 

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
Interface is absolutely abstract and cannot be instantiated. A Java abstract class also 
cannot be instantiated, but can be invoked. any variable declare in the interface are final or constant. 
one can creat an instance of an anonymous subclass of your abstract class. And then it could be invoked 
the method from abstract class reference pointing to subclass object 

what is Access Specifier?
public and no modifier – class level, easily Access.
private – members can only access.
protected – CAN be accessed from ‘same package’ and a subclass existing in any package can access.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
OOP -> Object Oriented Programming 
Encapsulation: encapsulation is the hiding of data implementation by restricting access to accessors and
mutators
Abstraction: Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user. 
Inheritance: In java one class could derived form another. It's to get the fields and methods of its superclass, this
feature called inheritance.
Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take many forms. 

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
API -> Application Programming Interface
List of API -> CORE Java API, OSGi, JMF, Google, Android, SE, ME , JSP

Does java support multiple inheritance?
Java support multiple inheritance.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Method overloading allows class to have multiple methods with the same name but different signature type.

What is method overriding and when it happens?
If a class inherits a method from its super class, then the method could be overridden if it't not final;

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
In Java, exceptions are objects. during a program compilation if the execution of the program behave 
unexpectedly, exception occurred. In java try-catch and throw exception two most popular way to handle exception   

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
The static keyword in Java means that the variable or function is shared between all instances of that class.
In class variable or method with static key word, variable can be access by all the methods and the method could
be access without class initiation. 

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
In Java we use final keyword to variables to make its values not to be changed.

What is final, finally and finalize?
Key word final is used toward the unchangeable variable.
finally is used in a try/catch statement to execute code always
finalize is called when an object is garbage collected. You rarely need to override it

What is a constructor ?
Constructor is a special type of method that doesn't return anything, the name has to same name as class, 
and takes multiple parameters in order to initiate object. 

What is "this" keyword in java ?
The this keyword is used when you need to use class global variable in the constructors. this is a reference to 
the current object — the object whose method or constructor is being called. 

What is "super" keyword in java?
The keyword "Super" is used inside a sub-class method definition to call a method defined in the super class.
Private methods of the super-class cannot be called. Only public and protected methods can be called by the super keyword.

What is JVM stand for ?
Java virtual machine

What version of java are you using?
1.8

What is JAR stand for ?
Java Archive

What is compile time and run time?
When an application is executing or running in JVM, it is called runtime.
A compile time error is a problem such as a syntax error or missing file reference that prevents the program from successfully compiling.

What is heap?
The Java heap is the amount of memory allocated to applications running in the JVM. 

How java manage it's memory?
Local variables live on the stack
– Allocated at method invocation time
– Deallocated when method returns
Other data lives on the heap
– Memory is allocated with new
– But never explicitly deallocated
