Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

Need to check the answer, seems not correct. 
1) why do we need data structure?
:-use of an appropriate data structure enables a computer system to perform its task
:-more efficiently, by how it retrieves and stores data.

2) List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
:-compiler design, simulation, A.I. , Numerical analysis and statistics

3) what is an Array?
:- a series of Objects in which all of them are the same size and shape
:-example int [] arr=new int[10]; is an integer array of size 10.

4) what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
:-In terms of performance Array and ArrayList provides similar performance in
:-terms of constant time for adding or getting element if you know index.
:-Though automatic resize of ArrayList may slow down insertion a bit.
 
5) what is LinkedList?
:- an ordered set of data elements, each containing a link to its successor(and sometimes its predecessor).

6) what is queue?
:-a collection for holding elements prior to processing.

7) what is stack?
:- a collection with two operations, push to add and pop to remove

8) what is FIFO and LIFO?
:-FIFO: first in first out; LIFO: last in first out

9) what is the order of complexity?
:-is finding the upper limit for the growth of some function;
:-for example if our sort algorithms require a constant amount of 
:-extra space then its space complexity is O(n) 

10)what is the best case to search an element from an array?
:- depends if the desired element is the first element in the array then
that case would be the best.

11)what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
:-it is difficult to determine teh worst case

12) what is tree in data structure?
:- abstract data type 

13) what is graph in data structure?
:-a structure consisting of a set of arrays and a set of edges

14) what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
:-HashMap is non synchronized and not thread safe whereas HashTable is thread safe and synchronized.

15) What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
:-RDBMS:Array; Network data model: Graph; Hierarchical data model: Trees

16) How HashMap works in java?
In hashing, hash functions are used to link key and value in 
:-HashMap. Objects are stored by calling put(key, value) method 
:-of HashMap and retrieved by calling get(key) method

17)What is Big-(O)-notation?
:- describes how long an algorithm takes to run

18)Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
:-QuickSort: Best(O(n log(n)); Average(O(nlog(n));worst(O(N^2)
:-InsertionSort: Best(O(n));Average(O(n^2));worst(O(n^2))

19) Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of adding element.
  b)In terms of removing element.
  c)In terms of searching element.
